In this team project that was made in quarter 1 of 2nd year of university (September-October 2022), we have made a device made out of two parts that are connected via nRF modules. One of 
them is the switch and the other the sensor. The point of this whole project is to improve sustainability. Hence, the sensor detects the light intensity in a room and alarms the user that he should turn off a light because of wasted lighting in the room(which can 
be from another light turned on, the outside light, etc.). The user can then turn some light off or use one sensor button that sends a signal to the switch device that is implanted on the switch of a light and has an arm that presses the switch such that the light
turns off without the user having to get up and interrupt his workflow. We have a demo video for this.
