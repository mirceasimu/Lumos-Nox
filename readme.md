In this team project that was made in quarter 1 of the 2nd year of university (September-October 2022), we have made a device made out of two parts that are connected via nRF modules. One of 
them is the switch and the other the sensor. The point of this whole project is to improve sustainability. Hence, the sensor detects the light intensity in a room and alarms the user that he should turn off a light because of wasted lighting in the room(which can 
be from another light turned on, the outside light, etc.). The user can then turn some light off or use one sensor button that sends a signal to the switch device that is implanted on the switch of a light and has an arm that presses the switch such that the light
turns off without the user having to get up and interrupt his workflow. The devices both work on Arduino, have the nRF module to communicate with eachother. The sensor one also has the light sensor and a LED matrix that shows a sad face if the lighting is too high and a smiley one if everything is ok. The switch device has a motor to move the arm to turn on/off the switch of a light, depending on what the user wishes.
